//In this approach I take two pointer left and right placed both initially at 0 and after that iterate through the array.
//If right pointer is zero then it swap the left pointer and after that increment both pointer left++ and right++;
//Else if right pointer is non-zero then only right pointer increase.
//Hence Problem Solved
